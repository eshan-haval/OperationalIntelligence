The technology and tools we will be using in our project with their description.

Github - Great collaboration starts with communication. Our environment has common Git Repository for review changes, comment on lines of codes, report issues and submission of individual contribution. It is integrated with other application and tool such as eclipse development environment for constant versioning of code. It is easy to work with project collaborators and do development across team. It is a web based repository which offers all distributed division control and source code management functionality.

Hadoop - It is a java based programming framework that supports the processing of large data sets in a distributed computing environment. It is part of the Apache project sponsored by the Apache Software Foundation. Its distributed file system facilitates rapid data transfer rates among nodes and allows the system to continue operating uninterrupted in case of a node failure.

HDFS - Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) is a file system that spans all the nodes in a Hadoop cluster for data storage. It links together the file systems on many local nodes to make them into one big file system.

YARN- Apache Hadoop YARN (short, in self-deprecating fashion, for Yet Another Resource Negotiator) is a cluster management technology. It is one of the key features in second-generation Hadoop. YARN combines a central resource manager that reconciles the way applications use Hadoop system resources with node manager agents that monitor the processing operations of individual cluster nodes. Running on commodity hardware clusters, Hadoop has attracted particular interest as a staging area and data store for large volumes of structured and unstructured data intended for use in analytics applications. Separating HDFS from MapReduce with YARN makes the Hadoop environment more suitable for operational applications that can't wait for batch jobs to finish.

NOSql Database- Apache HBase is a column-oriented key/value data store built to run on top of the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). HBase is known for providing strong data consistency on reads and writes, which distinguishes it from other NoSQL databases. Much like Hadoop, an important aspect of the HBase architecture is the use of master nodes to manage region servers that distribute and process parts of data tables.

Message Broker- Apache Kafka is a distributed publish-subscribe messaging system designed to replace traditional message brokers.

Spark - Apache Spark is an open-source parallel processing framework that enables users to run large-scale data analytics applications across clustered systems. Apache Spark can process data from a variety of data repositories, including the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), NoSQL databases and relational data stores such as Apache Hive. Spark supports in-memory processing to boost the performance of big data analytics applications, but it can also do conventional disk-based processing when data sets are too large to fit into the available system memory.
